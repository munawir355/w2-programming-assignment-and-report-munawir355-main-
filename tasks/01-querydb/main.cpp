 *
 * The user can pass the following parameters to this application:
 *
 * -db <database file>          Specifies the path to the database file (required)
 * -showAll                     Writes all records to the terminal
 * -sid <student ID> [-n|-g|-p] Writes the record with a specific student ID (integer).
 *                              By default, this displays the complete record
 *                              Add one of the following to reduce the information
 *                                 -n       Just display the name
 *                                 -g       Just display the mode codes and grades
 *                                 -p       Just display the phone number
 *
 * ****************
 * *** EXAMPLES ***
 * ****************
 * querydb                                  Creates an example database computing.txt (done for you)
 * querydb -db computing.txt -showAll       Displays all records in the database computing.txt (done for you)
 * querydb -db computing.txt -sid 12345     Displays the complete record for student with ID 12345 (done for you)
 *
 * ********* The above three examples are already implemented, but not fully tested *********
 *
 * For the -sid option, you can further narrow down the information displayed (not yet implemented)
 *
 * ****************
 * *** EXAMPLES ***
 * ****************
 * 
 * querydb -db computing.txt -sid 12345 -n      Displays only the name for student with ID 12345, or an error if not found
 * querydb -db computing.txt -sid 12345 -g      Displays only the module codes and grades for student with ID 12345, or an error if not found
 * querydb -db computing.txt -sid 12345 -p      Displays only the phone number for student with ID 12345, or an error if not found
 * querydb -db computing.txt -sid 12345 -n -p   Display both the name and the phone number for student with ID 12345
 * 
 * *************
 * *** NOTES ***
 * *************
 * 
 * o You should test the existing application first and verify which of the above is already complete.
 * o The -n, -g and -p switches have not yet been implemented (this is your task).
 * o You need to handle error conditions, and inform the user appropriately.
 * o Errors should be communicated with the user.
 * o No tag should be repeated (e.g. you cannot specify -sid twice).
 * o Open files should always be closed before the program exits.
 * o You do not have to use Object Orientated Programming in this task, but it is recommended.
 * o Try to write your code such that is can be reused in other tasks.
 * o Code should be consistently indented and commented
